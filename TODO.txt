Image Importer:
	- PNG files at least don't seem to load properly when trying to be used in openGL

OBJ importer:
	- Crashes with multiple objects
	
Materials:
	- Decide what to do
	
Camera:
	- Rotational Controls
	
Here are some ideas:
	
	- Python script to convert obj file to easy processed binary file.
	- Why not do the same with materials.
	- Why not write a pymark parser for C?
