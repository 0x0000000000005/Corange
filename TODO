TODO List
=========

To Finish Demos
---------------

* Sea Game - Add depth pass and foam effects? Walk around on moving deck?

Tweaks/Cleanup
--------------

* Optimise SDL_ReadLine to read more than one character at once.
* const stuff where needed (including asset stuff)
* Convert skeleton stuff to quaternions - though not sure if I trust my quaternion code. Slerp them nicely.
* Reorganize shaders into component specific and general sections. Make them unload and load correctly on init/finish of components.
* Remove all fixed function stuff inc builtins from all shaders.

In the Future
-------------

* Make multi material behaviour default.
* Remove shader program assets - merge into material?
* PLY loader
* Other UI elements
* LUA wrappers for asset, entity, ui managers
