	With SDL and OpenGL.
	
	:: Running ::
	
		To run a game call corange from the command line with the first arg being the name of the game to play. For example if you wish to play the "cello" demo run the command:
			
			$ corange cello
			
		Otherwise it will default to the blank game called "empty" which will just display a blank screen.

		* Small and Simple
	
	
	:: Installation ::
	
		To install on Windows you need MinGW with gcc and from that it should just compile
		To install on Unix you need probably lots of things including a new Makefile.
